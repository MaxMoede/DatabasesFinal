For David:
I used eclipse for creating this java project,
What you wanna do is download the tar file from 
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=477057
Unzip it, then you wanna open up the project in eclipse and 
right click on the project folder -> click on build path -> add external JAR -> find the jar you downloaded from the earlier link and click on that.
